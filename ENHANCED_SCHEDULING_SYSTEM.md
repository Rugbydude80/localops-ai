## Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup

Run the migration to create the new tables:

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### 2. Backend Setup

The enhanced scheduling system is already integrated into the main API. No additional setup required.

### 3. Frontend Integration

Import and use the enhanced components:

```typescript
import EnhancedSchedulingModal from '../components/EnhancedSchedulingModal'
import { enhancedApi } from '../lib/enhancedApi'

// Use the modal
<EnhancedSchedulingModal
  isOpen={showEnhancedScheduling}
  onClose={() => setShowEnhancedScheduling(false)}
  onGenerate={handleEnhancedScheduleGeneration}
  businessId={businessId}
  selectedDate={selectedDate}
/>
```

### 4. Create Initial Templates

Create some basic shift templates to get started:

```typescript
// Create opening shift template
await enhancedApi.createShiftTemplate(businessId, {
  name: "Opening Shift",
  description: "Early morning opening shift",
  start_time: "07:00",
  end_time: "15:00",
  break_start: "12:00",
  break_duration: 30,
  required_skills: ["kitchen", "front_of_house"],
  min_staff_count: 2,
  max_staff_count: 4,
  hourly_rate: 15.00
})
```

## Configuration Options

### AI Scheduling Parameters

```typescript
const schedulingParams = {
  use_templates: true,           // Use shift templates
  respect_availability: true,    // Respect employee availability
  optimize_hours: true,         // Optimize weekly hours
  strategy: 'balanced',         // Scheduling strategy
  special_events: [],           // Special events affecting demand
  staff_notes: [],              // Staff-specific notes
  constraints: {}               // Business constraints
}
```

### Employee Availability Types

- `available`: Preferred working times
- `if_needed`: Secondary availability for coverage gaps
- `unavailable`: Hard constraints that AI must respect

### Scheduling Strategies

- `balanced`: Balance all factors equally
- `cost_optimized`: Minimize labor costs
- `staff_preferred`: Prioritize staff preferences
- `coverage_focused`: Ensure all shifts are covered

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Templates Available**: Create shift templates first before generating schedules
2. **Low Coverage Rate**: Check employee availability and increase staff count
3. **High Overtime**: Adjust weekly hour targets or add more staff
4. **AI Confidence Issues**: Review employee skills and availability data

### Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate scheduling strategies for your business needs
- Regularly update employee availability preferences
- Monitor and adjust weekly hour allocations
- Review and optimize shift templates periodically
