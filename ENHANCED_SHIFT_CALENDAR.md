## Business Rules

### Scheduling Constraints

1. **Skill Matching**: Staff must have the required skills for the shift
2. **Availability**: Staff must be available during shift times
3. **Maximum Hours**: Staff cannot exceed weekly/daily hour limits
4. **Minimum Rest**: Required rest periods between shifts
5. **Fair Distribution**: Equal distribution of shifts among qualified staff
6. **Labor Cost**: Optimize for cost while maintaining quality

### AI Scheduling Logic

1. **Historical Analysis**: Consider past performance and reliability
2. **Staff Preferences**: Respect availability and preference settings
3. **Business Constraints**: Enforce all business rules
4. **Coverage Optimization**: Ensure adequate staffing levels
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Balance quality with labor costs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Supabase Credentials**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and API keys
   - Ensure the service role key has proper permissions

2. **AI Scheduling Fails**
   - Check OpenAI API key configuration
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Staff Not Available**
   - Verify staff availability settings
   - Check for conflicting assignments
   - Ensure staff have required skills

4. **Calendar Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Ensure database is properly configured

### Performance Optimization

1. **Large Datasets**: Use pagination for staff and shift lists
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
4. **Database Indexing**: Index foreign keys and date fields

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for staff
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive scheduling and trend analysis
3. **Integration**: Connect with payroll and time tracking systems
4. **Notifications**: Push notifications for schedule changes
