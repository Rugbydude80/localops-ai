# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Auto-Schedule System is a comprehensive restaurant staff scheduling tool that provides managers with an intuitive drag-and-drop calendar interface and AI-powered automatic scheduling capabilities. The system aims to dramatically reduce the time managers spend creating and editing rosters while maintaining transparency in scheduling decisions through clear reasoning for each assignment.

7. WHEN editing is complete THEN the user SHALL be able to save changes before publishing

### Requirement 5
