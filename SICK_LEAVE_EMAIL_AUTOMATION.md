# Automated Sick Leave Email Notification System

## Overview

The LocalOps AI platform now includes a fully automated sick leave notification system that automatically sends emails to available staff members with matching skills when someone calls in sick. This system ensures quick shift coverage and minimizes operational disruption.

## How It Works

### 1. Sick Leave Reporting
When a staff member reports sick leave:
- The system identifies the affected shift and required skills
- Automatically finds all available staff with matching skills
- Sends personalized email notifications to qualified staff
- Creates in-app notifications for real-time updates
- Notifies managers for oversight

### 2. Smart Staff Filtering
The system intelligently filters staff based on:
- **Skill Matching**: Only staff with the required skills receive notifications
- **Availability**: Excludes staff already assigned to overlapping shifts
- **Active Status**: Only considers active staff members
- **Reliability Score**: Prioritizes staff with higher reliability scores

### 3. Automated Email Notifications
Each qualified staff member receives a detailed email containing:
- **Urgent subject line** with shift details
- **Personalized greeting** with staff name
- **Complete shift information** (date, time, position, location)
- **Sick leave details** (who called in and why)
- **Staff qualifications** (skills and reliability score)
- **Clear response options** (YES/NO/MAYBE)
- **Professional formatting** with restaurant branding
